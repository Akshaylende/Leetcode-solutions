# Problem Statement -
We define query quality as:

The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.

We also define poor query percentage as:

The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.

Write a solution to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.

Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

Return the result table in any order.

# Query - 
SELECT 
    query_name,
    round(SUM(rating/position)/count(*), 2)as quality,
    round(sum(if(rating<3,1,0))*100/ count(*), 2) as poor_query_percentage
FROM 
    Queries
where query_name is NOT NULL
GROUP BY 
    query_name;
