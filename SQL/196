# Problem Statement -
Write a solution to delete all duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id.

For SQL users, please note that you are supposed to write a DELETE statement and not a SELECT one.

For Pandas users, please note that you are supposed to modify Person in place.

After running your script, the answer shown is the Person table. The driver will first compile and run your piece of code and then show the Person table. The final order of the Person table does not matter.

# Query - 
delete  
    r2
from 
    Person r1, Person r2
where 
    r1.email = r2.email  and    r1.id < r2.id;
