# Problem Statement -
Write a solution to report the fraction of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in, rounded to 2 decimal places. In other words, you need to determine the number of players who logged in on the day immediately following their initial login, and divide it by the number of total players.

# Query - 
select
    round(count(a1.event_date)/(select count(distinct player_id) from Activity), 2) as fraction
from 
    Activity a1
join 
    Activity a2
on 
    a1.player_id = a2.player_id
where 
    DATEDIFF(a2.event_date, a1.event_date) = 1
    and a1.event_date = (select min(event_date) from Activity where player_id = a1.player_id);
